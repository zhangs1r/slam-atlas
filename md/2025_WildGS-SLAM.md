## Abstract

We present WildGS-SLAM, a robust and efficient monocular RGB SLAM system designed to handle dynamic environments by leveraging uncertainty-aware geometric mapping. Unlike traditional SLAM systems, which assume static scenes, our approach integrates depth and uncertainty information to enhance tracking, mapping, and rendering performance in the presence ofmoving objects. We introduce an uncertainty map, predicted by a shallow multi-layer perceptron and DI-NOv2features, to guide dynamic object removal during both tracking and mapping. This uncertainty map enhances dense bundle adjustment and Gaussian map optimization, improving reconstruction accuracy. Our system is evaluated on multiple datasets and demonstrates artifact-free view synthesis. Results showcase WildGS-SLAM’s superior performance in dynamic environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## 1. Introduction

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in dynamic environments is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with broad applications in autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and robotics. Traditional SLAM systems [6, 31, 45] rely on assumptions of scene rigidity, making them vulnerable to tracking errors in dynamic scenes where objects move independently. Although some recent approaches [4, 34, 52] incorporate motion segmentation, semantic information, and depth-based cues to handle dynamic content, they often struggle to generalize across scenes with varied and unpredictable motion patterns. This issue is especially acute in real-world scenarios where dynamic distractors, occlusions, and varying lighting conditions introduce significant ambiguity for SLAM systems.

Uncertainty-aware methods have recently gained attention in scene reconstruction and view synthesis, particularly for handling complex environments with partial occlusions, dynamic objects, and noisy observations. For instance, NeRF On-the-go [36] and WildGaussians [22] introduced uncertainty estimation to improve the rendering quality of neural radiance fields in real-world scenarios, enabling enhanced view synthesis in the presence of motion and varying light conditions. Such approaches provide valuable insights into modeling ambiguities and have shown strong results in highly dynamic environments. However, they focus on sparse-view settings and require camera poses as input.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel SLAM approach, namely WildGS-SLAM, that leverages a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, designed to perform robustly in highly dynamic environments using only monocular RGB input. Similar to [22, 36], our method takes a purely geometric approach. It integrates uncertainty-aware tracking and mapping, which removes dynamic distractors effectively without requiring explicit depth or semantic labels. This approach enhances tracking, mapping, and rendering while achieving strong generalizability and robustness across diverse real-world scenarios. Results showcase its improved performance over prior work in both indoor and outdoor scenes, supporting artifact-free rendering and high-fidelity novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings.

Specifically, we train a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) given 3D-aware, pre-trained DINOv2 [54] features to predict per-pixel uncertainty. The MLP is trained incrementally as input frames are streamed into the system, allowing it to dynamically adapt to incoming scene data. We leverage this uncertainty information to enhance tracking, guiding dense bundle adjustment (DBA) to prioritize reliable areas. Additionally, during mapping, the uncertainty predictions inform the rendering loss in Gaussian map optimization, helping to refine the quality of the reconstructed scene. By optimizing the map and the uncertainty MLP independently, we ensure maximal performance for each component. To evaluate our method in diverse and challenging scenarios, we collect a new dataset including indoor and outdoor scenes.

Our main contributions are as follows:

• A monocular SLAM framework, namely WildGS-SLAM, utilizing a 3D Gaussian representation that operates robustly in highly dynamic environments, outperforming existing dynamic SLAM methods on a variety of dynamic datasets and on both indoor and outdoor scenarios.

• An uncertainty-aware tracking and mapping pipeline that enables the accurate removal of dynamic distractors without depth or explicit semantic segmentation, achieving high-fidelity scene reconstructions and tracking.

• A new dataset, namely Wild-SLAM Dataset, featuring diverse indoor and outdoor scenes, enables SLAM evaluation in unconstrained, real-world conditions. This dataset supports comprehensive benchmarking for dynamic environments with varied object motions and occlusions.

## 2. Related Work

## 2.1. Traditional Visual SLAM

Most traditional visual SLAM [6, 20, 30, 31] methods assume static scenes, however, the presence of dynamic objects can disrupt feature matching and photometric consistency, leading to substantial tracking drift. To address this, many approaches enhance robustness in dynamic environments by detecting and filtering out dynamic regions, focusing on reconstructing the static parts of the scene. Common approaches to detect dynamic objects include warping or reprojection techniques [3, 34, 39], off-the-shelf optical flow estimators [44, 60], predefined class priors for object detection or semantic segmentation [16, 41], or hybrids of these strategies [2, 4, 40, 51]. Notably, ReFusion [34] requires RGB-D input and uses a TSDF [5] map representation, leveraging depth residuals to filter out dynamic objects. DynaSLAM [2] supports RGB, RGB-D, and stereo inputs, leveraging Mask R-CNN [9] for semantic segmentation with predefined movable object classes, and detects unknown dynamic objects in RGB-D mode via multi-view geometry.

To our knowledge, no existing traditional SLAM methods support monocular input without relying on prior class information, likely due to the sparse nature of traditional monocular SLAM, which limits the use of purely geometric cues for identifying dynamic regions. Our SLAM approach, however, leverages a 3D Gaussian scene representation to provide dense mapping, enabling support for monocular input without prior semantic information.

## 2.2. Neural Implicit and 3DGS SLAM

Recently, Neural Implicit Representations and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have gained substantial interest in SLAM research, as they offer promising advancements in enhancing dense reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Early SLAM systems like iMAP [43] and NICE-SLAM [64] pioneered the use of neural implicit representations, integrating mapping and camera tracking within a unified framework. Subsequent works have further advanced these methods by exploring various optimizations and extensions, including efficient representations [15, 21, 47], monocular settings [1, 61, 65], and the integration of semantic information [23, 56, 63]. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [18] introduces an efficient and flexible alternative representation for SLAM and has been adopted in several recent studies [8, 10, 12, 17, 24, 26, 35, 53, 62]. Among these, MonoGS [28] is the first near real-time monocular SLAM system to use 3D Gaussian Splatting as its sole scene representation. Another notable advancement is Splat-SLAM [37], the state-of-the-art (SoTA) in monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM, offering high-accuracy mapping with robust global consistency. These methods excel in tracking and reconstruction but typically assume static scene conditions, limiting their robustness as performance degrades significantly in dynamic environments.

Some methods have focused explicitly on handling dynamic environments. Most approaches extract a dynamic object mask for each frame before passing it to the tracking and mapping components. DG-SLAM [52], DynaMon [38], and RoDyn-SLAM [14] combine segmentation masks with motion masks derived from optical flow. DDN-SLAM [25] employs object detection combined with a Gaussian Mixture Model to distinguish between foreground and background, checking feature reprojection error to enhance tracking accuracy. However, these approaches rely heavily on prior knowledge of object classes and depend on object detection or semantic segmentation, limiting their generalizability in real-world settings where dynamic objects may be unknown a priori and difficult to segment.

Figure 2. System Overview. WildGS-SLAM takes a sequence of RGB images as input and simultaneously estimates the camera poses while building a 3D Gaussian map G of the static scene. Our method is more robust to the dynamic environment due to the uncertainty estimation module, where a pretrained DINOv2 model [54] is first used to extract the image features. An uncertainty MLP P then utilizes the extracted features to predict per-pixel uncertainty. During the tracking, we leverage the predicted uncertainty as the weight in the dense bundle adjustment (DBA) layer to mitigate the impact of dynamic distractors. We further use monocular metric depth to facilitate the pose estimation. In the mapping module, the predicted uncertainty is incorporated into the rendering loss to update G. Moreover, the uncertainty loss is computed in parallel to train P. Note that $\mathcal { P }$ and $\mathcal { G }$ are optimized independently, as illustrated by the gradient flow in the gray dashed line. Faces are blurred to ensure anonymity.

In contrast, our method is purely geometric even with monocular input. While similar works such as NeRF On-thego [36] and WildGaussians [22] demonstrate distractor removal in dynamic environments, they are primarily designed for sparse-view settings with known camera poses. Inspired by these approaches, we also leverage the pre-trained 2D foundation model DINOv2 [33] and use an MLP to decode them into an uncertainty map. We extend this framework to tackle the challenging sequential SLAM setting, integrating specific design components that enable robust tracking and high-fidelity mapping within our 3DGS backend.

A concurrent work, MonST3R [58], introduced a feedforward approach for estimating scene geometry in the presence of motion. It detects moving objects by thresholding the difference between the predicted optical flow [49] and the reprojection flow, estimated using an extended version of DUSt3R [48]. However, this approach is limited to short sequences, and its use of point clouds as the scene representation does not support view synthesis.

## 3. Method

Given a sequence of RGB frames $\{ I _ { i } \} _ { i = 1 } ^ { N }$ captured in a dynamic environment, WildGS-SLAM tracks the camera pose while reconstructing the static part of the scene as a 3D Gaussian map (Sec. 3.1). To mitigate the adverse impact of moving objects in tracking and eliminate them from the 3D reconstruction, we utilize DINOv2 features [33] and a shallow MLP to decode them to per-pixel uncertainty (Sec. 3.2). We further introduce how this uncertainty is integrated into the optical-flow-based tracking component (Sec. 3.3). In parallel with tracking, we leverage this uncertainty to progressively expand and optimize the 3D Gaussian map with uncertainty-aware loss functions (Sec. 3.4). The overview of WildGS-SLAM is in Fig. 2.

## 3.1. Preliminary on 3D Gaussian Splatting

We utilize a 3D Gaussian representation [18] to reconstruct the static part of the scanned environment. The scene is represented by a set of anisotropic Gaussians $\mathcal { G } = \{ g _ { i } \} _ { i = 1 } ^ { K }$ Each Gaussian $g _ { i }$ contains color $\boldsymbol { c } _ { i } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 3 }$ , opacity $o _ { i } \in [ 0 , 1 ]$ mean $\pmb { \mu } _ { i } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 3 }$ , and covariance matrix $\pmb { \Sigma } _ { i } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 3 \times 3 }$

Rendering. We follow the same rendering approach as in the original 3DGS [18] but omit spherical harmonics to speed up optimization, as in [28, 55]. Given a camera-to-world pose ω and the projection function $\Pi _ { c }$ that maps 3D points onto the image frame, the 3D Gaussians can be "splatted" onto the 2D image plane by projecting the mean $\pmb { \mu }$ and covariance matrix Σ as $\pmb { \mu } ^ { \prime } = \Pi _ { c } \left( \omega ^ { - 1 } \pmb { \mu } \right)$ and $\Sigma ^ { \prime } = \dot { J } R \Sigma R ^ { T } J ^ { T }$ , where $\textbf {  { J } }$ is the Jacobian of the linear approximation of the projective transformation and R is the rotation component of $\omega$ . The opacity of a Gaussian $g _ { i }$ at pixel $\mathbf { x } ^ { \prime }$ is:

$$
\alpha _ { i } = o _ { i } \exp ( - \frac { 1 } { 2 } ( { \pmb x } ^ { \prime } - { \pmb \mu } _ { i } ^ { \prime } ) ^ { T } { \pmb \Sigma } _ { i } ^ { \prime - 1 } ( { \pmb x } ^ { \prime } - { \pmb \mu } _ { i } ^ { \prime } ) ) .\tag{1}
$$

The rendered color $\hat { I }$ and depth $\hat { D }$ at pixel $\mathbf { x } ^ { \prime }$ are obtained by blending the 3D Gaussians $\mathcal { G } ^ { \prime }$ overlapping with this pixel, sorted by their depth relative to the camera plane:

$$
\hat { I } = \sum _ { i \in \mathcal { G } ^ { \prime } } \pmb { c } _ { i } \alpha _ { i } \prod _ { j = 1 } ^ { i - 1 } \left( 1 - \alpha _ { j } \right) , \hat { D } = \sum _ { i \in \mathcal { G } ^ { \prime } } \hat { d } _ { i } \alpha _ { i } \prod _ { j = 1 } ^ { i - 1 } \left( 1 - \alpha _ { j } \right)\tag{2}
$$

where $\hat { d } _ { i }$ is the z-axis depth of the center of $g _ { i }$ . This process is fully differentiable, enabling incremental map updates as new frames are streamed (we discuss details in Sec. 3.4).

## 3.2. Uncertainty Prediction

WildGS-SLAM’s main contribution is to eliminate the impact of moving distractors in both mapping and tracking. To achieve this, we use an uncertainty prediction component inspired by [22, 36] while additionally incorporating our own custom depth uncertainty loss during training. For each input frame, we extract DINOv2 [33] features and utilize an uncertainty MLP, trained on-the-fly with streamed frames, to predict a per-pixel uncertainty map that mitigates the impact of distractors in both tracking and mapping.

Feed-Forward Uncertainty Estimation. Given an input image $I _ { i } ,$ we use a pre-trained DINOv2 feature extractor $\mathcal { F }$ to derive image features, $F _ { i } = \mathcal { F } ( I _ { i } )$ . Instead of the original DINOv2 model [33], we use the finetuned version from [54], which injects 3D awareness into the model. The features are used as input to a shallow uncertainty MLP P to predict an uncertainty map $\beta _ { i } = \mathcal { P } ( F _ { i } )$ . We bilinearly upsample $\beta _ { i }$ to the original input frame resolution, which is then used in both tracking (Sec. 3.3) and mapping (Sec. 3.4).

Uncertainty Loss Function. For the uncertainty loss functions, we adopt the modified SSIM loss and two regularization terms from NeRF On-the-go [36], along with the L1 depth loss term:

$$
\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { d e p t h } } = | \hat { D } _ { i } - \tilde { D } _ { i } | _ { 1 } ,\tag{3}
$$

where ${ \mathcal { L } } _ { \mathrm { d e p t h } }$ represents the L1 loss between the rendered depth $\hat { D } _ { i }$ and the metric depth ${ \tilde { D } } _ { i }$ , as estimated by Metric3D v2 [11]. We find that this additional depth signal effectively improves the model’s ability to distinguish distractors, enhancing the training of the uncertainty MLP. Therefore the total uncertainty loss is:

$$
\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { u n c e r } } = \frac { \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { S S I M } } ^ { \prime } + \lambda _ { 1 } \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { u n c e r \_ D } } } { \beta _ { i } ^ { 2 } } + \lambda _ { 2 } \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e g \_ V } } + \lambda _ { 3 } \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e g \_ U } } ,\tag{4}
$$

where $\lambda _ { * }$ are hyperparameters, $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { S S I M } } ^ { \prime }$ is the modified SSIM loss, $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e g \_ V } }$ minimizes the variance of predicted uncertainty for features having high similarity, and the last term $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e g \_ U } } = \log \beta _ { i }$ prevents $\beta _ { i }$ from being infinitely large. Please refer to NeRF On-the-go [36] for details on $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { S S I M } } ^ { \prime } :$ $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e g \_ V } }$ , and $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e g \_ U } }$ . We use ${ \mathcal { L } } _ { \mathrm { u n c e r } }$ to train $\mathcal { P }$ in parallel with map optimization (Sec. 3.4).

## 3.3. Tracking

Our tracking component is based on the recent method DROID-SLAM [45] with the incorporation of depth and uncertainty into the DBA to make the system robust in dynamic environments. The original DROID-SLAM [45] uses a pretrained recurrent optical flow model coupled with a DBA layer to jointly optimize keyframe camera poses and disparities. This optimization is performed over a frame graph, denoted as $G = ( V , E )$ , where V represents the selected keyframes and E represents the edges between keyframes.

Following [37, 57], we incorporate loop closure and online global BA to reduce pose drift over long sequences.

Depth and Uncertainty Guided DBA. Different from [37, 45, 57], we integrate the uncertainty map estimated by $\mathcal { P }$ into the BA optimization objective to deal with the moving distractors. In addition, we utilize the metric depth estimated by Metric3D V2 [11] to stabilize the DBA layer, since $\mathcal { P }$ is trained online and can not always give accurate uncertainty estimation, especially during the early stages of tracking. For each newly inserted keyframe $I _ { i } ,$ we first estimate its monocular metric depth ${ \tilde { D } } _ { i }$ and add it to the DBA objective alongside optical flow:

$$
\begin{array} { r l r } {  { \arg \operatorname* { m i n } _ { \omega , d } \sum _ { ( i , j ) \in E } \| \tilde { p } _ { i j } - \Pi _ { c } ( \omega _ { j } ^ { - 1 } \omega _ { i } \Pi _ { c } ^ { - 1 } ( p _ { i } , d _ { i } ) ) \| _ { \Sigma _ { i j } / \beta _ { i } ^ { 2 } } ^ { 2 } } } \\ & { } & { +  \lambda _ { 4 } \sum _ { i \in V } \| M _ { i } ( d _ { i } - 1 / \tilde { D } _ { i } ) \| ^ { 2 } , } \end{array}\tag{5}
$$

The first term is the uncertainty-aware DBA objective where $\tilde { p } _ { i j }$ is the predicted pixel position of pixels $p _ { i }$ projected into keyframe $j$ by the estimated optical flow; this is iteratively updated by a Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU) [45]. Π<sub>c</sub> represents the projection from 3D points to 2D image planes, $\omega _ { i }$ is the camera-to-world transformation for keyframe $i , d _ { i }$ is the optimized disparity, and $\| \cdot \| _ { \Sigma _ { i j } / \beta _ { i } ^ { 2 } }$ is the Mahalanobis distance [29] which weighs the error terms by confidence matrix $\Sigma _ { i j }$ from the flow estimator [45] and our uncertainty map $\beta _ { i } .$ As a result, pixels associated with moving objects will have minimal impact on the optimization in DBA.

The second term is a disparity regularization term to encourage $1 / d _ { i }$ to be close to the predicted depth for all i in the graph nodes V. We find that this regularization term can stabilize the pose estimation, especially when the uncertainty MLP $\mathcal { P }$ has not converged to provide reliable uncertainty $\beta _ { i }$ while moving objects are dominant in the image frames. $M _ { i }$ is a binary mask that deactivates disparity regularization in regions where $\tilde { D } _ { i }$ is unreliable, computed via multi-view depth consistency (details provided in the supplementary).

## 3.4. Mapping

After the tracking module predicts the pose of a newly inserted keyframe, its RGB image I, metric depth ${ \tilde { D } } ,$ , and estimated pose ω will be utilized in the mapping module to expand and optimize the 3DGS map. Given a new keyframe processed in the tracking module, we expand the Gaussian map to cover newly explored areas, using $\tilde { D } _ { i }$ as proxy depth, following the RGBD strategy of MonoGS [28]. Before optimization, we also actively deform the 3D Gaussian map if the poses of previous keyframes are updated by loop closure or global BA, as in Splat-SLAM [37].

Map update. After the map is expanded, we optimize the Gaussians for a fixed number of iterations. We maintain a local window of keyframes selected by inter-frame covisibility, similar to MonoGS [28]. At each iteration, we randomly sample a keyframe with at least 50% probability evenly distributed for the keyframes in the local window, while all the other keyframes share the remaining probability equally. For a selected keyframe, we render the color <sup>ˆ</sup>I and depth $\hat { D }$ image by Eq. (2). The Gaussian map G is optimized by minimizing the render loss $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e n d e r } } .$

$$
\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e n d e r } } = \frac { \lambda _ { 5 } \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { c o l o r } } + \lambda _ { 6 } \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { d e p t h } } } { \beta ^ { 2 } } + \lambda _ { 7 } \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { i s o } } ,\tag{6}
$$

where the color loss $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { c o l o r } } .$ , combines L1 and SSIM losses as follows:

$$
\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { c o l o r } } = ( 1 - \lambda _ { \mathrm { s s i m } } ) \Vert \hat { I } - I \Vert _ { 1 } + \lambda _ { \mathrm { s s i m } } \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { s s i m } } .\tag{7}
$$

Unlike the loss function for static scenes, here we incorporate the uncertainty map $\beta ,$ which serves as a weighting factor for $\scriptstyle { \mathcal { L } } _ { \mathrm { c o l o r } }$ and ${ \mathcal { L } } _ { \mathrm { d e p t h } }$ , minimizing the influence of distractors during mapping optimization. Additionally, isotropic regularization loss $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { i s o } }$ [28] constrains 3D Gaussians to prevent excessive elongation in sparsely observed regions.

At each iteration, we also compute ${ \mathcal { L } } _ { \mathrm { u n c e r } }$ given the rendered color and depth image as in Eq. (4). ${ \mathcal { L } } _ { \mathrm { u n c e r } }$ is then used to train the uncertainty MLP P in parallel to the map optimization. As shown in [36], it is crucial to separately optimize the 3D Gaussian map and the uncertainty MLP. Therefore, we detach the gradient flow from ${ \mathcal { L } } _ { \mathrm { u n c e r } }$ to the Gaussians ${ \mathcal { G } } ,$ , as well as from $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e n d e r } }$ to $\mathcal { P } _ { \cdot }$

## 4. Experiments

## 4.1. Experimental Setup

Datasets. We evaluate our approach on the Bonn RGB-D Dynamic Dataset [34] and TUM RGB-D Dataset [42]. To further assess performance in unconstrained, real-world settings, we introduce the Wild-SLAM Dataset, comprising two subsets: Wild-SLAM MoCap and Wild-SLAM iPhone. The Wild-SLAM MoCap Dataset includes 10 RGB-D sequences recorded with an Intel RealSense D455 camera [13] in a room equipped with an OptiTrack [32] motion capture system, providing ground truth trajectories. The Wild-SLAM iPhone Dataset comprises 7 non-staged RGB sequences recorded with an iPhone 14 Pro. Since ground truth trajectories are not available for this dataset, it is used solely for qualitative experiments. The Wild-SLAM MoCap Dataset provides RGB-D frames at 720 × 1280 resolution, while the Wild-SLAM iPhone Dataset offers RGB frames at 1440 × 1920. For efficiency, in our experiments, we downsample these to $3 6 0 \times 4 8 0$ and $3 6 0 \times 6 4 0$ , respectively. Dataset details are offered in supplementary.

Baselines. We compare WildGS-SLAM with the following 13 methods. (a) Classic SLAM methods: DSO [6], ORB-SLAM2 [30], and DROID-SLAM [45]; (b) Classic SLAM methods dealing with dynamic environments: Refusion [34] and DynaSLAM [2]; (c) Static neural implicit and 3DGS SLAM systems: NICE-SLAM [64], MonoGS [28], and Splat-SLAM [37]; (d) Concurrent neural implicit and 3DGS SLAM systems dealing with dynamic environments: DG-SLAM [52], RoDyn-SLAM [14], DDN-SLAM [25], and DynaMoN [38]; (e) the very recentfeed-forward approach MonST3R [58]; and (f) a concurrent deep SLAM framework for dynamic videos: MegaSaM [27]. To address its substantial VRAM usage (65 frames requiring 33 GB), we adapt the model by integrating a custom sliding-window inference strategy, enabling SLAM-style sequential input processing (referred to as MonST3R-SW; implementation details provided in the supplementary). We include two versions of DynaSLAM [2] in our experiments. The first, DynaSLAM (RGB), uses only monocular input without leveraging geometric information or performing inpainting. The second, DynaSLAM (N+G), utilizes RGB-D input, incorporates geometric information, and performs inpainting. Since not all methods are open-sourced and run on all sequences, we provide detailed sources for each baseline method’s metrics in supplementary.

Metrics. For camera tracking evaluation, we follow the standard monocular SLAM pipeline, aligning the estimated trajectory to the ground truth (GT) using evo [7] with Sim(3) Umeyama alignment [46], and then evaluate (ATE RMSE) [42]. Note that, although our tracking optimizations are performed solely on keyframe images, we recover camera poses for non-keyframes and evaluate the complete camera trajectory. Please refer to the supplementary for details. Additionally, we employ PSNR, SSIM [50], and LPIPS [59] metrics to evaluate the novel view synthesis quality.

## 4.2. Mapping, Tracking, and Rendering

Wild-SLAM Mocap Dataset. We begin our evaluation on the newly captured Wild-SLAM MoCap dataset. As shown in Table 1, our method significantly outperforms other baselines on average. The only exception is a slight increase in tracking error in the Person sequence, where the single person moves in a simple pattern, making it easier for DynaSLAM [2] to use semantic segmentation to mask out dynamic regions within the frames. All other sequences contain various types of distractors beyond humans, with different forms of occlusion. Although Refusion [34] and DynaSLAM (N+G) [2] use geometric approaches leveraging raw depth information to identify dynamic objects, they still underperform compared to our WildGS-SLAM with only monocular input. While MonST3R [58] has demonstrated strong performance on short sequences, extending it to longer sequences with a sliding window approach (MonST3R-SW), even with substantial overlap, still leads to significant tracking errors.

We further evaluate rendering results in Fig. 3, Table 2, and Fig. 4. In Fig. 3, we render from the input view to demonstrate our distractor removal capability. In comparison to other baselines, our method produces artifact-free, realistic renderings of the static scene. To evaluate novel view synthesis, we capture additional images of static scenes as part of the dataset. For each dynamic sequence, we select a subset of static scene images that match the coverage of the dynamic sequence. The results in Table 2 and Fig. 4 showcase that our method has the best novel view synthesis performance thanks to our uncertainty aware mapping.

Wild-SLAM iPhone Dataset. We further evaluate our approach on in-the-wild sequences captured using an iPhone RGB camera. Fig. 5 presents rendering results comparisons, along with visualizations of the uncertainty map of our method and the dynamic mask from MonST3R [58]. Our method achieves the best rendering results with an accurate uncertainty map, even able to assign higher uncertainty to the shadows of distractors. In contrast, MonST3R [58] depends heavily on the performance of pretrained models, which may lead to missed detections of entire dynamic objects. On the other hand, MegaSAM [27] leverages only neighboring frames, lacking enough multi-view information, which results in less reliable motion masks.

Figure 6. View Synthesis Results on Bonn RGB-D Dynamic Dataset [34]. We show results on the Balloon (first row) and Crowd (second row) sequences. For Balloon, ReFusion [34] fails to remove the person from the TSDF, and DynaSLAM(N+G)[2] struggles with limited static information from multiple views, resulting in partial black masks. In Crowd, DynaSLAM(N+G)[2] cannot detect dynamic regions, defaulting the original image as the inpainted result. In contrast, ours achieves superior rendering even with motion blur in the input.

the highest overall performance, underscoring its robustness. In contrast, DynaMoN [38] first performs initial camera tracking and then refines it offline, which is time-consuming. Meanwhile, DynaSLAM (N+G) [2] and DDN-SLAM [25] rely on depth sensor data combined with semantic segmentation. In Fig. 6, we show rendered images from the input view. Our method successfully removes dynamic objects while achieving realistic rendering with minimal artifacts.

## 4.3. Ablation Study

We ablate our key design choices in Table 5. For (c), we pass predefined distractor types to YOLOv8<sup>\*</sup> to generate bounding boxes, then apply the Segment Anything Model (SAM) [19] for segmentation within each box. It achieves similar results on Bonn and TUM datasets, as their distractors are primarily humans. Our method outperforms all other variants, confirming the effectiveness of our design choices.

## 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced WildGS-SLAM, a novel SLAM approach designed to handle dynamic environments through a purely geometric framework. By leveraging a shallow MLP to predict per-pixel uncertainty based on pre-trained 3D-aware features, our method efficiently isolates static and dynamic scene elements, enabling robust tracking and rendering. Through extensive evaluations on both newly collected and existing datasets, we demonstrated that WildGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic SLAM tasks, excelling in both tracking and novel view synthesis.

Limitation. Our method’s uncertainty predictor is trained on-the-fly with input frames, making it challenging to recognize distractors when a limited number of views capture the same regions. Introducing motion priors could improve handling of dynamic scenes and enhance tracking robustness.
